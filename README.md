# 🧠 DSA – Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my comprehensive **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository!  
This project is designed to organize and showcase my problem-solving journey across various coding platforms.

It includes:
- ✅ Platform-wise folders (Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, HackerRank)
- ✅ Topic-wise subfolders (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Clean and readable solutions in C++, Python, and Java
- ✅ Notes for revision and learning

## 🔍 Platforms Covered

- Codeforces
- LeetCode
- CodeChef
- HackerRank

Each platform contains folders categorized by topic, making it easy to navigate and revise.
